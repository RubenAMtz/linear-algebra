Substraction between two points in a plane gives you a vector lying on
the plane.

The law of cosines supports the idea behind "orthogonality"
given a triangle A, B and C (hipotenusa).

C = A + B + 2ABCos(tetha)
Remember: given the sides A, B and C we can say that, that is equals to:
||A||, ||B|| and ||C||

Thus: ||C|| = ||A|| + ||B|| + 2||A||||B|| Cos tetha
and ||C|| = ||A-B||^2

Given a plane equation Ax + By + Cz = D , you can obtain a normal vector
to the plane by using its coefficients:
normal_vector = Ai + Bj + Ck, D only defines a shift of that vector

The distance from a point to a plane, given that the point is not on the
plane is given by:

(AXo + BYo + CZo - D) / sqrt(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)

Where A, B, C and D are the coeffiecients of the plane equation
and Xo, Yo and Zo are the coordinates of the point itself.

The idea behind it, is that the shortest distance to the plane is 
parallel to the normal vector to the plane.

A system is called under determined when there are less equations than
unknown variables, bringing you to a solution of the system with infinte
solutions.

A system is called over determined when there are more equations than
uknown variables, bringing you to the solution of the system with no
solutions, unless the system is non linearly independent (some of the
equations are combination of others)
