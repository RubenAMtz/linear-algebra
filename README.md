# Work in Progress

## Install
$git clone https://github.com/jsgilberto/linear-algebra

## So far:

### Class Vector properties:

 - Components  
 - Magnitude  
 - Dimensions  
 - Versors (orthogonal unit vectors)
 
### Methods defined for Vector:

 - Calculate dimensions
 - Calculate magnitude
 - Calculate versors
 - Compare dimensions between vectors
 - Dot product
 - Check collinearity with another vector
 - Calculate angle
 - Calculate polar form (for 2D vectors)
 - Calculate unit vector
 
## To be implemented
 
 - Numerical errors are being fixed
 - Matrix definition
 - Matrix methods
 - Numerical methods (derivative for gradient, divergence, etc)
